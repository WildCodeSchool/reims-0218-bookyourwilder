# Face Your Wilder Project

## About

This project focuses on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), a JavaScript run-time environment. What's more, we'll be making requests to the server, and store elements in a database.
**Face Your Wilder** (even if the repository is named Book Your Wilder) will act as a social media for the [Wild Code School](https://wildcodeschool.fr)'s students.

## What's planned

* Registration
* Access to other's profile page
* Many ways to contact someone (e-mail, Facebook, LinkedIn, Github, etc.)
* Easy editing by going to an administration page
